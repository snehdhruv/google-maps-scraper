## Example Templates by Category

### Restaurant Example:
"Hey [Name],

Noticed you're running [Restaurant Name] in [Neighborhood]. If your TV's on right now, it's probably showing random YouTube ads instead of today's specials or your happy hour deals.

Trillboards changes that - it's a free app that lets you display your menu, daily specials, and even Instagram posts on your screens. Takes 2 minutes to set up, no equipment needed.

Plus, when you're slow, local businesses can pay you to show their ads.

I'm based here in [City] and helping local spots take back their screens. Can I swing by this week for a quick demo?

Cheers,
Sneh"

### Gym Example:
"Hey [Name],

Your members at [Gym Name] are probably watching random YouTube ads between sets instead of class schedules or workout tips.

Trillboards fixes that - free app that lets you control your screens. Show class times, trainer spotlights, member achievements, whatever you want. Setup takes 2 minutes.

Bonus: Local businesses pay to advertise during off-hours.

I'm local to [Neighborhood] and getting gyms set up this week. Want me to stop by?

Best,
Sneh"
