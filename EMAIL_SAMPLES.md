Hey ZQ's Barbershop team,

Sneh here from Trillboards. We're a local company helping businesses like yours take control of their TV screens.

I bet your TVs are currently showing random YouTube ads or cable commercials, right? Probably not the best look while folks are waiting for a fresh cut.

With Trillboards, you can easily replace those ads with your own content – promote your services, show off before & after pics, or even display a QR code for easy online booking.

It's a free app, takes about 2 minutes to set up, and you don't need any extra hardware. Plus, you can even earn money by letting other local businesses advertise on your screens!

I'm based nearby and would love to swing by ZQ's for a quick demo sometime. Let me know if you're interested.

Best,

Sneh, CEO @ Trillboards, sneh@trillboards.com

Hey Desert Sky Mall Restaurants Team,

Sneh here, from Trillboards. We're a local company right here in the Phoenix area, helping businesses like yours take control of their TV screens.

I was checking out your restaurants online (4.0 stars with over 13,000 reviews – impressive!) and got to thinking... are your TVs just showing the same old YouTube or cable ads? Probably for competitors, right?

Trillboards lets you ditch those generic ads and show off your own stuff – daily specials, menu highlights, even QR codes for easy ordering. Plus, it's a free app, takes about 2 minutes to set up, and needs no extra hardware.

Even better, you can actually *earn* money by letting other local businesses advertise on your screens!

I'd love to swing by Desert Sky Mall sometime this week and show you a quick demo. Let me know what day works best.

Best,

Sneh, CEO @ Trillboards, sneh@trillboards.com
